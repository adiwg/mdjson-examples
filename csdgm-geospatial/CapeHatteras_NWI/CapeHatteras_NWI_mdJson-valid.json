Predictions about response of coastal birds to effects of hurricanes will be essential for anticipating and countering environmental impacts. This project will assess coastal bird populations, behavior, and nesting in Hurricane Sandy-impacted North Carolina barrier islands. The project comprises three components: 1) ground-based and airborne lidar analyses to examine site specific selection criteria of coastal birds; 2) NWI classification habitat mapping of DOI lands to examine habitat change associated with Hurricane Sandy, particularly in relation to coastal bird habitat; and 3) a GIS-based synthesis of how patterns of coastal bird distribution and abundance and their habitats have been shaped by storms such as Hurricane Sandy, coastal development, population density, and shoreline management over the past century. We will trace historic changes to shorebird populations and habitats in coastal North Carolina over the past century. Using historic maps and contemporary imagery, the study will quantify changes in shorebird populations and their habitats resulting from periodic storms such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012, to development projects such as the Intracoastal Waterway early in the last century, as well as more recent urban development. We will synthesize existing data on the distribution and abundance of shorebirds in North Carolina and changes in habitats related to storms, coastal development, inlet modifications, and shoreline erosion to give us a better understanding of historic trends for shorebirds and their coastal habitats. Historic data on the distribution and abundance of shorebirds are available from a variety of sources and include bird species identification, location, activity, habitat, and band data. Habitat maps of federal lands in the study area will be created using National Wetlands Inventory mapping standards to assess storm impacts on available nesting habitat. Ground-based LIDAR and high-accuracy GPS data will be collected to develop methods to estimate shorebird nest elevation and microtopography to make predictions about nest site selection and success. Microtopography information collected from lidar data in the area immediately surrounding nest site locations will be used to analyze site specific nesting habitat selection criteria related to topography, substrate (coarseness of sand or cobble), and vegetation cover. The data will be used in future models to assess storm impacts on nest locations, predict long-term population impacts, and influence landscape-scale habitat management strategies that might lessen future impacts of hurricanes on coastal birds and lead to better restoration alternatives.",

The NWI habitat data classified are outlined in the; Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States (https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Documents/Classification-of-Wetlands-and-Deepwater-Habitats-of-the-United-States.pdf)and (http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Documents/NWI_Wetlands_and_Deepwater_Map_Code_Diagram.pdf); (Cowardin and other 1979, FWS/OBS  79/31). Uplands are derived from a land use and land cover classification system for use with remote sensor data (Anderson, J.R., Hardy, E.E., Roach J.T., and Witmer R.E., 1976, A land use and land cover classification system for use with remote sensor data: U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 964, 28 p.). Depending on project objectives, when mapping broad categories of data, some detail can be lost due to overall project goals. All upland categories, whether vegetated or unvegetated will be classified as Upland. Detailed habitat mapping was made possible using 6-inch pixel resolution, 3 Band (RGB- True Color) stereo and orthoimages covering the project area footprints. Imagery was acquired by the North Carolina Statewide Orthoimagery Program. The digital mosaic of the high resolution color infrared aerial photography project area is brought into ArcMap Software where photointerpretation begins. Habitat types specific to this project were delineated by overlaying project area boundaries onto the imagery and delineating features. Ancillary data sets with similar resolutions, were utilized to help classify areas that may be difficult to identify. Imagery of the project area is also viewed on screen in stereo which helps determine vegetation height and proper habitat classification. Where available, LIDAR data is utilized for elevation information that help discern habitats from one another especially where floating aquatics may be present. Once the photointerpreter completes their initial interpretation of the project area, the photointerpreter will perform a quality assurance review of their own work making corrections or improving their initial interpretation work. After the quality assurance review is complete, the lead photointerpreter will perform the final quality control review. In this review, linework is checked, database is checked for missing labels or inappropriate labels, topology and acreage tables are checked using a USFWS database tool.",
